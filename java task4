Task: 4                                                          Date: 23/05/2024

Write a program to implement a snake and ladder game.
• You can take a player number as input.
• Generate dice score using random method from Math class.
• Add dice score to the player.
• Check for the snake or the ladder if the player goes through.
• Update the player score after a snake or a ladder if any.
• Check if the player&#39;s score is 100, then declare the player is the winner and exit.
• Check if the player’s score is &gt;100, then reduce the dice score.
• Repeat until any one of the players wins the game.
